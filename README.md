# Grand Theft Auto San Andreas
When describing GTA: SA with an ENB preset, here's what you can expect:

Improved Graphics: An ENB preset can drastically enhance the visual quality of the game. Textures, objects, and character models can look sharper and more detailed, creating a more immersive experience.

Lighting Enhancements: ENB presets often modify lighting effects, including the way sunlight, moonlight, and artificial lights interact with the environment. This can lead to more realistic and dynamic lighting that enhances the overall atmosphere of the game.

Enhanced Shadows: Shadows in the game can become more detailed and realistic with an ENB preset. This adds depth and dimension to the environment, making it feel more immersive.

Color Grading and Saturation: ENB presets can alter the color palette and saturation levels of the game, giving it a more cinematic or stylized appearance. This can change the mood and ambiance of different areas and situations.

Depth of Field and Blur Effects: Some ENB presets introduce depth of field effects, selectively blurring the background or foreground to mimic real-world camera lenses. This can draw attention to specific objects or characters and create a more realistic depth perception.

Bloom and Lens Flares: ENB presets might add bloom effects to simulate the scattering of light, creating a soft and dreamy look. Lens flares can also be added to create a more cinematic atmosphere, especially when looking towards bright light sources.

Post-Processing Filters: Various post-processing filters can be applied to the game, such as film grain, vignettes, and motion blur. These effects can give the game a unique visual style but may be subject to personal preference.

Performance Impact: It's important to note that using an ENB preset can significantly impact your system's performance. The graphical enhancements and effects come at the cost of increased demand on your hardware, potentially leading to lower frame rates.

Overall, using an ENB preset in GTA: SA can transform the game's visual presentation, making it more immersive, cinematic, and aesthetically pleasing. Players who enjoy fine-tuning the graphics of their games to achieve a specific look or atmosphere often find ENB presets to be a valuable addition to their modding experience. Just like other mods, it's important to follow installation instructions carefully and ensure compatibility with any other mods you might be using.
